                <p>After many long years in the medical field, I decided it was time for a change, so I jumped into the world of software development. I realized my true passions lied in programming and creating software. I still use my medical training to make sure my code is healthy and bug free. With a passion for problem-solving and coding, I now spend my days making computers work their magic. In my spare time, I enjoy introducing technology to others and teaching them how to use the
                skills I have learned!</p>
